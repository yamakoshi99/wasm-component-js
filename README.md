# wasm-component-js

This project is a JavaScript implementation of a WebAssembly component model. It serves as a demonstration of how to structure a web application using components and utility functions.

## Project Structure

```
wasm-component-js
├── src
│   ├── app.js          # Entry point of the application
│   ├── components      # Directory containing component definitions
│   │   └── index.js    # Exports components for use in the application
│   └── utils           # Directory containing utility functions
│       └── index.js    # Exports utility functions for use in the application
├── package.json        # npm configuration file
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wasm-component-js.git
